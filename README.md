# 🍅 PomoBar

**The Minimalist Pomodoro Timer That Keeps You Focused in Obsidian**

Boost your productivity without ever leaving your notes. PomoBar is a sleek, unobtrusive Pomodoro timer that lives in your status bar—with optional audio notifications to keep you on track. Seamlessly integrate the Pomodoro Technique into your workflow with visual and audible cues.

## ✨ Why PomoBar?

### 🧘 Stay Focused, Not Distracted

PomoBar lives in your status bar, providing a constant but subtle reminder of your work session without cluttering your workspace or interrupting your flow.

### 🔊 Optional Audio Notifications

Get gentle sound alerts when timers complete. Choose from built-in sounds or upload your own custom audio files from your vault.

### 🖱️ Intuitive & Quick Controls

Manage your timers with simple clicks—no need to open new windows or type commands.

### 🔄 Automated Flow

Optional auto-progression automatically starts the next timer in your Pomodoro cycle, or pause after each session for manual control.

### ⚙️ Your Rhythm, Your Rules

Deep work sessions aren't one-size-fits-all. Custom-tune your work/break intervals to match your energy levels.
