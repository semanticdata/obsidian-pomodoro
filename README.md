While learning to make Obsidian plugins, I thought it would be a good idea to make a Pomodoro timer that lives in the status bar. I use one all the time!

## ✨ Features

-   Clean and simple status bar timer
-   Default 25-minute Pomodoro sessions with 15 and 5-minute break options
-   Easy controls:
    -   Left click to start/stop the timer
    -   Middle click to cycle between 25/15/5 minute durations
    -   Right click to reset
-   Minimal interface that doesn't get in your way

## 📦 Installation (_NOT AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY PLUGINS YET!_)

1. Open Obsidian Settings
2. Navigate to Community Plugins (_NOT AVAILABLE YET!_) and disable Safe Mode
3. Click Browse and search for "Status Bar Pomodoro"
4. Install the plugin
5. Enable the plugin in your Community Plugins list

## 🛠️ Usage

1. Look for the timer in your status bar (shows as "25:00" when not started)
2. Left click to start the timer
3. Left click again to pause the timer
4. Middle click to cycle between different durations (25/15/5 minutes)
5. When paused, right click to reset to the current duration
6. Timer will automatically stop when it reaches 00:00

## 🚀 Development

This plugin is built using the Obsidian Plugin API.

## First time developing plugins?

Quick starting guide for new plugin devs:

-   Check if [someone already developed a plugin for what you want](https://obsidian.md/plugins)! There might be an existing plugin similar enough that you can partner up with.
-   Make a copy of this repo as a template with the "Use this template" button (login to GitHub if you don't see it).
-   Clone your repo to a local development folder. For convenience, you can place this folder in your `.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-name` folder.
-   Install NodeJS, then run `npm i` in the command line under your repo folder.
-   Run `npm run dev` to compile your plugin from `main.ts` to `main.js`.
-   Make changes to `main.ts` (or create new `.ts` files). Those changes should be automatically compiled into `main.js`.
-   Reload Obsidian to load the new version of your plugin.
-   Enable plugin in settings window.
-   For updates to the Obsidian API run `npm update` in the command line under your repo folder.

## Releasing new releases

-   Update your `manifest.json` with your new version number, such as `1.0.1`, and the minimum Obsidian version required for your latest release.
-   Update your `versions.json` file with `"new-plugin-version": "minimum-obsidian-version"` so older versions of Obsidian can download an older version of your plugin that's compatible.
-   Create new GitHub release using your new version number as the "Tag version". Use the exact version number, don't include a prefix `v`. See here for an example: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin/releases
-   Upload the files `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css` as binary attachments. Note: The manifest.json file must be in two places, first the root path of your repository and also in the release.
-   Publish the release.

> You can simplify the version bump process by running `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major` after updating `minAppVersion` manually in `manifest.json`.
> The command will bump version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, and add the entry for the new version to `versions.json`

## Adding your plugin to the community plugin list

-   Check the [plugin guidelines](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Releasing/Plugin+guidelines).
-   Publish an initial version.
-   Make sure you have a `README.md` file in the root of your repo.
-   Make a pull request at https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases to add your plugin.

## How to use

-   Clone this repo.
-   Make sure your NodeJS is at least v16 (`node --version`).
-   `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies.
-   `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

## Manually installing the plugin

-   Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.

## Improve code quality with eslint (optional)

-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that analyzes your code to quickly find problems. You can run ESLint against your plugin to find common bugs and ways to improve your code.
-   To use eslint with this project, make sure to install eslint from terminal:
    -   `npm install -g eslint`
-   To use eslint to analyze this project use this command:
    -   `eslint main.ts`
    -   eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
-   If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder:
    -   `eslint .\src\`

## Funding URL

You can include funding URLs where people who use your plugin can financially support it.

The simple way is to set the `fundingUrl` field to your link in your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
	"fundingUrl": "https://buymeacoffee.com"
}
```

If you have multiple URLs, you can also do:

```json
{
	"fundingUrl": {
		"Buy Me a Coffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com",
		"GitHub Sponsor": "https://github.com/sponsors",
		"Patreon": "https://www.patreon.com/"
	}
}
```
