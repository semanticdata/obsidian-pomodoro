## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses focused work intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. This approach helps maintain concentration and prevents burnout during long work sessions.

**PomoBar's default cycle:**

1. 🍅 **Work**: 25 minutes of focused work
2. ☕ **Short Break**: 5 minutes of rest
3. 🍅 **Work**: Another 25-minute session
4. ☕ **Short Break**: Another 5-minute rest
5. *Repeat 2 more times...*
6. 🛋️ **Long Break**: 15 minutes of extended rest

After 4 work sessions, you get a longer break to recharge before starting the cycle again.
