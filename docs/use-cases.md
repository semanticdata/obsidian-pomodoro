# Use Cases & Workflows

This page provides examples of how you can integrate PomoBar into your daily workflows.

## For Students

Use PomoBar to break up your study sessions into manageable chunks. For example, you could use the default 25-minute timer for focused study, followed by a 5-minute break to stretch or grab a snack.

## For Developers

When working on a coding task, use PomoBar to stay focused and avoid burnout. The timer can help you remember to take regular breaks, which can improve your concentration and problem-solving abilities.

## For Writers

If you're a writer, PomoBar can help you stay on track and meet your writing goals. Use the timer to set aside dedicated writing time, and use the breaks to step away from your work and clear your head.
