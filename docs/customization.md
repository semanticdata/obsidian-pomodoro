# Advanced Customization

PomoBar is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to tailor its behavior and appearance to your exact preferences. This guide covers advanced customization options available through the settings.

## Custom Timer Durations

You can override the default Pomodoro timer durations (25, 5, and 15 minutes) to match your personal workflow. To do this, open the PomoBar settings in Obsidian and modify the following fields:

- **Pomodoro Duration**: The length of a work session (default: 25 minutes).
- **Short Break Duration**: The length of a short break (default: 5 minutes).
- **Long Break Duration**: The length of a long break (default: 15 minutes).

## Work Interval Count

The `workIntervals` setting determines how many work sessions you complete before a long break. The default is 4, following the traditional Pomodoro Technique.

## Status Bar Appearance

You can customize the appearance of the status bar timer to minimize distractions or to match your aesthetic preferences.

- **Toggle Status Bar**: If you prefer a completely clean status bar, you can hide the timer entirely. This is useful when you want to focus on writing without any visual clutter. You can still control the timer using commands.
- **Toggle Icon**: You can hide the timer icon if you prefer a more minimalist look. The timer will still be visible, but it will take up less space in the status bar.

## Icons

The timer icon changes dynamically to provide at-a-glance information about the timer's state:

- **Timer Icon**: Indicates the timer is inactive and ready to start.
- **Play Icon**: Appears when the timer is running.
- **Pause Icon**: Shows when the timer is paused.

These icons ensure you can quickly check the timer's status without interrupting your workflow.

## Color Scheme

The timer's color scheme is designed to be consistent with Obsidian's native UI. The colors are subtle and should blend in with your current theme.

- **Inactive**: The timer is displayed in the default text color of your theme.
- **Running**: The timer is displayed in a slightly brighter color to indicate that it is active.
- **Paused**: The timer is displayed in a muted color to indicate that it is paused.

By adjusting these settings and leveraging the visual cues, you can create a personalized time management system that perfectly fits your needs.
