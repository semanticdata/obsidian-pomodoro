# Advanced Customization

PomoBar is designed to be highly customizable, allowing you to tailor its behavior and appearance to your exact preferences. This guide covers advanced customization options available through the settings.

## Custom Timer Durations

You can override the default Pomodoro timer durations (25, 5, and 15 minutes) to match your personal workflow. To do this, open the PomoBar settings in Obsidian and modify the following fields:

- **Pomodoro Duration**: The length of a work session (default: 25 minutes).
- **Short Break Duration**: The length of a short break (default: 5 minutes).
- **Long Break Duration**: The length of a long break (default: 15 minutes).

## Work Interval Count

The `workIntervals` setting determines how many work sessions you complete before a long break. The default is 4, following the traditional Pomodoro Technique.

## Extra Time

The `extraTime` option allows you to add a few extra minutes to timers, which can be useful for accommodating brief interruptions without fully pausing the timer.

## Status Bar Appearance

You can customize the appearance of the status bar icon with the following settings:

- **Use Icon**: Display a tomato icon next to the timer for better visibility.
- **Custom Status Bar Text**: Define custom templates for the status bar text using placeholders like `{time}` and `{status}`.

## Notifications

Customize the notification messages for timer completion to provide specific instructions or reminders.

By adjusting these settings, you can create a personalized time management system that perfectly fits your needs.
